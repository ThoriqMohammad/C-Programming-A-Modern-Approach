# C Programming Solutions

My solutions to K.N. King's "C Programming: A Modern Approach" book, chapter 2, programming project 6.

## What's Here
- Chapter 2: Programming Project 6 solution

## How to Run

cd Chapter-02

gcc ProgrammingProject2-6.c -o program

./program


## The Project

Modify the program of Programming Project 5 so that the polynomial is evaluated using the
following formula:
((((3x + 2)x – 5)x – 1)x + 7)x – 6
Note that the modified program performs fewer multiplications. This technique for evaluating polynomials is known as Horner’s Rule.

## Note
These are my practice solutions. Try solving yourself first!
