# C Programming Solutions

My solutions to K.N. King's "C Programming: A Modern Approach" book.

## What's Here
- Chapter 2: Programming Project 2 solution

## How to Run

cd Chapter-02

gcc ProgrammingProject2-2.c -o program

./program


## The Project
Write a program that computes the volume of a sphere with a 10-meter radius, using the formula v = 4/3πr^3. 
Write the fraction 4/3 as 4.0f/3.0f. (Try writing it as 4/3. What happens?) 
Hint: C doesn’t have an exponentiation operator, so you’ll need to multiply r by itself twice to compute r^3.

## Note
These are my practice solutions. Try solving yourself first!
