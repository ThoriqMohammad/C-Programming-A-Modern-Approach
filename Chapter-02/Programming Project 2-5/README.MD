# C Programming Solutions

My solutions to K.N. King's "C Programming: A Modern Approach" book, chapter 2, programming project 5.

## What's Here
- Chapter 2: Programming Project 5 solution

## How to Run

cd Chapter-02

gcc ProgrammingProject2-5.c -o program

./program


## The Project
Write a program that asks the user to enter a value for x and then displays the value of the
following polynomial:
3x^5 + 2x^4 – 5x^3 – x^2 + 7x – 6
Hint: C doesn’t have an exponentiation operator, so you’ll need to multiply x by itself
repeatedly in order to compute the powers of x. (For example, x * x * x is x cubed.)

## Note
These are my practice solutions. Try solving yourself first!
