My attempt to solve programming projects on K.N.King book's, C Programming a Modern Approach.
This is Chapter 2: C Fundamentals.
1.) Write a program that uses printf to display the following picture on the screen:
          *
         *
        *
  *    *
   *  *
     *
Answer :
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("       *\n");
    printf("      * \n");
    printf("     *  \n");
    printf("*   *   \n");
    printf(" * *    \n");
    printf("  *     \n");
    return 0;
}
