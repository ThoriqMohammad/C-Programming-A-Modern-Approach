## How to Fix It:

1. **Click the pencil icon** (✏️) to edit your README.md
2. **Delete EVERYTHING** in the editor
3. **Copy the ENTIRE text above** (from `# C Programming:` to `Happy coding! 🚀`)
4. **Paste it** into the editor
5. **Click "Commit changes"**

## Key Differences from Your Version:

- ✅ **Triple backticks** around folder structure: \``` before and after
- ✅ **Complete code block** for bash commands with closing triple backticks
- ✅ **No extra text** like "Complete Fixed Version"
- ✅ **Proper sections** with clear headers
- ✅ **Clean formatting** throughout

**Just copy and paste exactly what I provided above.** Don't modify it, don't add to it. That's the complete, correct README.md that will display properly on GitHub.
